The director Pontus Hultén accepted, provided that Nielsen assumed full economic and organisational responsibility for the project. In October 1968, Modellen – En model förettkvalitativtsamhälle (The Model – A Model for a Qualitative Society) opened and offered free access for all of Stockholm’s children, attracting more than 33,500 visitors, 20,000 of whom were children. New walls and a Masonite Goor were installed in the large hall, along with jungle gyms, a foamrubber basin, swings, climbing ropes and water chutes. Tools, paint, building materials and fabrics were at the children’s disposal during the entire course of the project to aid their creativity. The Royal Theatre donated a selection of period costumes to be used for dressing up, while Nielsen provided carnival masks of Charles de Gaulle, Mao Zedong, Lyndon B. Johnson and Fidel Castro. Loudspeakers were placed in each corner of the exhibition space, and the children operated turntables with a collection of LPs from every genre. In the restaurant, a number of TV screens carried live transmissions from the galleries, enabling visitors to take in the whole experience from outside. The white cube, a space designed for contemplation, was thus transformed into an open area for play and social irrationality, offering new possibilities for behaviour and proving that activity could not be prescribed.","Image link":"http://www.macba.cat/uploads/20120210/3566_770x510.jpg","Video link":null,"Location":"Moderna Museet, Stockholm, Sweden","Location coordinates":"59.3260466,18.0824992","Target participant qualifier 1":"Children","Target participant qualifier 2":"All","Number of participants":33500 ,"Type of engagement":"Object interaction","Type of audience":null,"Duration":"","Inspired by":null,"Inspires":null,"In opposition to":null,"In response to":null,"Works with":null,"Associated with":null,"Exhibited with":null},

In the Octagon of the Duveen Galleries, in what is now Tate Britain, Beuys lectured on humanity’s natural creative capacity and the power of direct democracy to shape society. He chalked his conceptual theories onto three blackboards (now in the Tate collection) and engaged the crowd in a free-form and often tense discussion. Not simply receptacles of ideas, the blackboards helped to determine the relationship between the artist and his audience, clearly signalling Beuys’s role as instructor. The format of the talk also served to position Beuys at the work’s centre.","Image link":"http://images.tate.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/grid-normal-12-cols/public/images/josephbeuysactionpiece.jpg?itok=YEpgINsm","Video link":null,"Location":"Tate Gallery, Millbank, London","Location coordinates":"51.4910635,-0.1453006","Target participant qualifier 1":"General","Target participant qualifier 2":"All","Number of participants":null,"Type of engagement":"Discursive","Type of audience":null,"Duration":"6 hours","Inspired by":null,"Inspires":null,"In opposition to":null,"In response to":null,"Works with":null,"Associated with":null,"Exhibited with":null},

    {"Author":"VR","Node name":"Information","Type of node":"Exhibitions","Start":"2 July 1970","End":"20 September 1970","Description":"An exhibition curated by Kynaston McShine and held at MoMA in New York between 2 July and 20 September 1970. The exhibition presented videos and installations by 100 international (e.g. Vito Acconci, Art & Language, Daniel Buren, Cildo Meireles, Hans Haacke, Dennis Oppenheim, OHO Group, Adrian Piper, Grupo Frontera). It included an early example of dealing with publicly accessible archives within the context of an exhibition and some of the participating artists confronted the issues of political and media based contents. 'With an artworld that knows more readily about current work, through reproductions and the wide dissemination of information via periodicals, and that has been altered by television, films and satellites, as well as the 'jet', it is now possible for artists to be truly international; exchange with their peers is now comparatively simple. The art historian’s problem of who did what first is almost getting to the point of having to date by the hour. Increasingly artists use mail, telegrams, telex machines, etc., for transmission of works themselves—photographs, films, documents—or of information about their activity. For both artists and their public it is a stimulating and open situation, and certainly less parochial than even five years ago. It is no longer imperative for an artist to be in Paris or New York. Those far from the 'art centers' contribute more easily, without the often artificial protocol that at one time seemed essential for recognition.'

    {"Author":"VR","Node name":"Cildo Meireles, Insertions into Ideological Circuits: Coca-Cola Project and Banknote Project","Type of node":"Other artwork","Start":"1970","End":"","Description":"Meireles conceived his two Insertions into Ideological Circuits projects for an exhibition of conceptual art held at The Museum of Modern Art, New York in 1970 entitled Information. The Coca-Cola Project and the Cédula or Banknote Project explore the notion of circulation and exchange of goods, wealth and information as manifestations of the dominant ideology. For the Coca-Cola Project Meireles removed Coca-Cola bottles from normal circulation and modified them by adding critical political statements, or instructions for turning the bottle into a Molotov cocktail, before returning them to the circuit of exchange. On the bottles, such messages as ‘Yankees Go Home’ are followed by the work’s title and the artist’s statement of purpose: ‘To register informations and critical opinions on bottles and return them to circulation’. The Coca-Cola bottle is an everyday object of mass circulation; in 1970 in Brazil it was a symbol of US imperialism and it has become, globally, a symbol of capitalist consumerism. As the bottle progressively empties of dark brown liquid, the statement printed in white letters on a transparent label adhering to its side becomes increasingly invisible, only to reappear when the bottle is refilled for recirculation. The Banknote Project followed a similar structure, with texts containing information and critical messages being stamped onto banknotes that were then returned to circulation. In both projects, the messages are in a mixture of English and Portuguese. In 1970, when Meireles produced the Insertions into Ideological Circuits projects, Brazil was undergoing the most oppressive period of its twenty-one year government by military dictatorship. At the time, the Insertions constituted a form of guerrilla tactics of political resistance in order to elude the strict state censorship enforced by the regime. Meireles has commented: 'The Insertions into Ideological Circuits arose out of the need to create a system for the circulation and exchange of information that did not depend on any kind of centralized control. This would be a form of language, a system essentially opposed to the media of press, radio and television – typical examples of media that actually reach an enormous audience, but in the circulation systems of which there is always a degree of control and channelling of the information inserted ... The way I conceived it, the Insertions would only exist to the extent that they ceased to be the work of just one person. The work only exists to the extent that other people participate in it. What also arises is the need for anonymity. By extension, the question of anonymity involves the question of ownership. When the object of art becomes a practice, it becomes something over which you can have no control or ownership.'","Image link":"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T12/T12328_10.jpg","Video link":null,"Location":"Brazil, public realm","Location coordinates":"-22.9103552,-43.728535","Target participant qualifier 1":"General","Target participant qualifier 2":"","Number of participants":null,"Type of engagement":"Object interaction","Type of audience":null,"Duration":"Indefinite","Inspired by":null,"Inspires":null,"In opposition to":null,"In response to":null,"Works with":null,"Associated with":"Kynaston McShine","Exhibited with":null},

Women over the age of 60, who had links to activism and activist activities in the UK and beyond, were invited to share their experiences, to create timelines of significant personal and political historical events, and to answer broader questions about their position in contemporary society. These then became the basis for a one-day public performance in the Tanks at Tate Modern, where over three hundred women came together to expand and share these conversations. Some stories were dictated and projected onto the walls of the Tank, in other cases members of the public could listen to the women discussing, and a number of conversations were filmed. Existing activist groups were also invited to hold their regular meetings in the space, and the entire event was blogged and live-tweeted by young women bloggers.

They drew together their findings to create an installation that was first displayed at the South London Art Gallery (now the South London Gallery) in 1975. Women and Work: A Document on the Division of Labour in Industry 1973-75 tells the stories of over 150 working women who participated in the project and offers a specific account of the participants' relationship to the workplace, as well as a more general examination of the changes in labour and industry brought about by the EPA. Harrison, Hunt and Kelly employed a sociological approach, collecting a vast amount of data through interviews, archival research and observation. Punch cards and rates of pay record the gap in wages between men and women, and films of life in the factory show women confined to repetitive, stationary and low-skilled tasks while men perform more physical and supervisory roles. The portraits and names of the female employees that are installed near the beginning of the display put human faces to the facts and figures. Women and Work was one of the earliest projects to tackle political and industrial issues from an overtly feminist perspective. The significance of the artists' intervention was recognized by factory management when they eventually banned Harrison, Hunt and Kelly from the site.","Image link":"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07797_9.jpg","Video link":null,"Location":"Riley Road, London","Location coordinates":"51.498614,-0.0779119","Target participant qualifier 1":"Profession","Target participant qualifier 2":"Gender identity","Number of participants":150,"Type of engagement":"Discursive","Type of audience":null,"Duration":"3 years","Inspired by":null,"Inspires":null,"In opposition to":null,"In response to":null,"Works with":null,"Associated with":null,"Exhibited with":null},

    {"Author":"VR","Node name":"Artist Placement Group","Type of node":"Initiatives","Start":"1966","End":"1982","Description":"The Artist Placement Group (APG) emerged in London in the 1960s. The organisation actively sought to reposition the role of the artist within a wider social context, including government and commerce, while at the same time playing an important part in the history of conceptual art during the 1960s and 1970s. The idea of Artist Placement stemmed from a group of UK artists, and was guided by John Latham and initiated by Barbara Steveni, who were experimenting with radical new forms of art. Directed by Steveni, the APG pioneered the concept of art in the social context. From the outset their notion of ‘placement’ acknowledged the marginalised position of the artist and sought to improve the situation. By enabling artists to engage actively in non-art environments, the APG shifted the function of art towards ‘decision-making’. Acting outside the conventional art gallery system, the APG attempted, through negotiation and agreement, to place artists within industry and government departments. The artist would become involved in the day-to-day work of the organisation and be paid a salary equal to that of other employees by the host organization, while being given the new role of maintaining sufficient autonomy to acting on an open brief. These placements resulted in a variety of artists’ reports, films, photographs, interviews, poetry and art installations. Artists of international repute, such as Keith Arnatt, Ian Breakwell, Stuart Brisley, George Levantis and David Hall, had important placements or early associations with the APG.","Image link":"http://www2.tate.org.uk/artistplacementgroup/images/homepageimg.jpg","Video link":null,"Location":"UK","Location coordinates":"51.5287352,-0.3817857","Target participant qualifier 1":"Profession","Target participant qualifier 2":"All","Number of participants":null,"Type of engagement":"Mixed","Type of audience":null,"Duration":"","Inspired by":null,"Inspires":null,"In opposition to":null,"In response to":null,"Works with":null,"Associated with":"John Latham, Stuart Brisley, Barbara Steveni","Exhibited with":null},

Brisley had worked during this year on an Artist Placement Group project in Peterlee in a community of miners and the title is indicative of his sympathy with the miners, and the lowness (and implied loneliness) of their working conditions. The work that preceded it had a similar preoccupation with digging and working in appalling conditions. In Bregenz he was presented with a strikingly different environment: a picturesque town by the side of a lake (Lake Constance) with a small mountain behind. This work is a response to this setting, the movement from mountain to flat ground and the lake (from the vertical to the horizontal). He chose to work on a quayside, using five roughly constructed frames which marked the limits of his physical reach. The materials which he employed were water, chalk, powder (flour) and paint (black and white). He made five separate statements using each of the materials, working in all for four days. In order to reduce the drama of the work (a character that Brisley abhors) the fifth frame was a mixture of black and white. On the last day the audience was large and Brisley avoided a climax to the work by jumping into the lake and swimming, replicating his drawing action in water, another medium.","Image link":"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T03/T03315_9.jpg","Video link":null,"Location":"Bregenz, Austria","Location coordinates":"47.4684475,9.6498534","Target participant qualifier 1":"General","Target participant qualifier 2":"","Number of participants":null,"Type of engagement":"Object interaction","Type of audience":null,"Duration":"","Inspired by":null,"Inspires":null,"In opposition to":null,"In response to":null,"Works with":null,"Associated with":"Artist Placement Group","Exhibited with":null},

In this work he was anxious to investigate the way in which buildings represent, or are symbols for, the culture we live in. The tower block seemed an obvious candidate for study. Willats, who was brought up in West London, chose Skeffington Court in Hayes because it was a model development in the local authority's eyes and had been opened by Harold Wilson in a spirit of confidence about this form of housing. It was also close to a high density low-rise development with which he hoped to make comparisons. He began by photographing the outside of the block and through this introduced himself to several of the tenants. (He used this material for another work ‘Vertical Living’ concurrent with ‘Living with Practical Realities’). The theme that Willats had in mind was the discovery and portrayal of the isolation of people within the tower block. He was introduced to Mrs Moran, who lived alone, and who was, in addition, elderly and thus further disadvantaged in relation to the society around her. Willats explained his work to her and began a collaboration which involved him photographing the flat and her, and tape recording interviews: this process continued for six months.","Image link":"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T03/T03296_9.jpg","Video link":null,"Location":"Skeffington Court, Hayes, London","Location coordinates":"51.5047393,-0.4198262","Target participant qualifier 1":"Elderly","Target participant qualifier 2":"Female","Number of participants":1,"Type of engagement":"Discursive","Type of audience":null,"Duration":"6 months","Inspired by":null,"Inspires":null,"In opposition to":null,"In response to":null,"Works with":null,"Associated with":null,"Exhibited with":null},
